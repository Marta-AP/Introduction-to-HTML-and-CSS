Nature is ever-changing, from the rugged coastlines to the soft hills, beautiful and raw. There is a special pulse, and you will feel it all year.”</blockquote>

				<p class="allbip">I wish I could say we explored everything, but with limited time, we could only visit a part of North Jutland. It was sad, but it is also a good excuse to travel back there and spend some more time around North Jutland's Western area.</p>

				<br>

				<p class="allbip">The journey start in Odense's station. We boarded the train that would take us further north than ever in our lives. More or les four hours later, we arrived in Aalborg just to spend there half a day and a night. Our plan was to finish our journey where we began, so we would have time to see anything we thought we missed the first day.</p>
